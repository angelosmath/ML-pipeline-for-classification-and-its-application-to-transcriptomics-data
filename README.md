# Semester project: Construction of Machine learning pipeline for classification and its
application to transcriptomics data.


## Abstract
The main goal of this project is to construct a machine learning pipeline for data classification, which
can distinctively predict the age class and if someone has followed shortly a resistance exercise
programme, based on the expression levels of specific genes. This genetic profile is selected from
common candidate genes that are connected to physical activity, as mentioned in scientific journals. For this implementation we chose the following dataset [GDS5218](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/GDSbrowser?acc=GDS5218#details) from NCBI GEO which
contains curated gene expression data coming from biopsy samples of muscle vastus lateralis. Two
cohorts of adults were studied, some of them who followed a 12-week resistance exercise programme
while the rest had the role of control. For this purpose we intend to try multiple classification methods,
such as KNN, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Neural Networks etc, for the aforementioned
dataset and choose the most precise or some combination. After the main part, if there are any accurate
results, our will is to generalize our implementation by using data derived from other studies following
the same protocols. If such predictions are accurate, could this constitute an indication of correlation
between genetic profile and muscle adaptations to resistance exercise?
